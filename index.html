              <a href="https://expo.io/@elizibin/words">Words</a>

                <p><a href="https://github.com/zibs/words-app">code</a></p>
                <p>I generally look up and write down every word I come across that I don't know. The "Words" app takes all these words and serializes them out to a React Native app from a Rails server. This app allows for quick and easy lookups of defintions, and also provides a little quiz section as a way for me to memorize and familiarize myself with these words further. Give it a shot!</p>
                <p>This app was built in conjunction with a talk I gave on <a href="https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron">Reactotron</a> at the React-Native Vancouver meetup this autumn. It's built using <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a> and uses <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux">redux</a>, <a href="https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga">redux-saga</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation">react-navigation</a>.</p>

                <p>This simple app supplemented a tech talk I gave at work about animations in React Native. It's not meant to do much other than showcase some of the animation possibilties that React Native harbours. Only one third-party animation library was brought in for this app, otherwise it focuses on <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/layoutanimation.html">Layout Animation</a>, and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html">Animated</a>. This app was also built using <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a>.</p>

                <p>I'm the web developer and a co-editor for the Charcuterie publication.</p>
                <p>I've built its initial web presence as a Ruby on Rails application so that I could take advantage of the amazing open-source gem <a href="http://alongslide.com/">alongslide</a> built by the folks at <a href="https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/">Triple Canopy</a>     to create memorable and unique online reading experiences. Take a look at one of the essays of this publication for an example of how its being used!</p>
                <p>Charcuterie strives to provide a forum for experimental writing and informed polemics without pedantry. It assembles a polyphony of inquiry and documents the messy landscape of opinion and critique that unravels in close proximity to where we work, live and make art in Vancouver.</p>

                <p>abcdefghijklnmoqprstuvwxyz is a site for poetry reviews and weblog on contemporary poetics. Currently updated infrequently, I used to design, develop, and write poetry reviews bi-weekly. Having it as a Ruby on Rails app made it easier to automate certain tasks while building it - dealing with assets, reusing partials, generating pages - as well as integrating a mailing list, webscraping (various poetry-related things), and to leave room for future additions such as an <code>ActionCable</code> chat section or something.</p>

                    This Ruby on Rails CMS makes up the online portion of their publication, and allows the students add
                    issues and essays to the site whenever they please.</p>
                <p>It's a very simple <code>CRUD</code> app, but it gets the job done.</p>
