      <a href="https://github.com/zibs/words-app">code</a>
    </p>
    <p>I generally look up and write down every word I come across that I don't know. The "Words" app takes all these words
      and serializes them out to a React Native app from a Rails server. This app allows for quick and easy lookups of definitions,
      and also provides a little quiz section as a way for me to memorize and familiarize myself with these words further.
      Give it a shot!</p>
    <p>This app was built in conjunction with a talk I gave on
      <a href="https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron">Reactotron</a> at the React-Native Vancouver meetup this autumn. It's built using
      <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a> and uses
      <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux">redux</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga">redux-saga</a>, and
      <a href="https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation">react-navigation</a>.</p>

    </p>
    <p>This simple app supplemented a tech talk I gave at work about animations in React Native. It's not meant to do much other
      than showcase some of the animation possibilties that React Native harbours. Only one third-party animation library
      was brought in for this app, otherwise it focuses on
      <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/layoutanimation.html">Layout Animation</a>, and
      <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html">Animated</a>. This app was also built using
      <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a>.</p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/zibs/charcuterie">code</a>
    </p>
    <p>I'm the web developer and a co-editor for the Charcuterie publication.</p>
    <p>I've built its initial web presence as a Ruby on Rails application so that I could take advantage of the amazing open-source
      gem
      <a href="http://alongslide.com/">alongslide</a> built by the folks at
      <a href="https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/">Triple Canopy</a> to create memorable and unique online reading experiences. Take a look at one of the essays of this
      publication for an example of how its being used!</p>
    <p>Charcuterie strives to provide a forum for experimental writing and informed polemics without pedantry. It assembles
      a polyphony of inquiry and documents the messy landscape of opinion and critique that unravels in close proximity to
      where we work, live and make art in Vancouver.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/zibs/abcdefghijklnmoqprstuvxyz">code</a>
    </p>
    <p>abcdefghijklnmoqprstuvwxyz is a site for poetry reviews and weblog on contemporary poetics. Currently updated infrequently,
      I used to design, develop, and write poetry reviews bi-weekly. Having it as a Ruby on Rails app made it easier to automate
      certain tasks while building it - dealing with assets, reusing partials, generating pages - as well as integrating
      a mailing list, webscraping (various poetry-related things), and to leave room for future additions such as an
      <code>ActionCable</code> chat section or something.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Scan is a contemporary art publication based in Winnipeg, MB run by students at the University of Winnipeg. This Ruby
      on Rails CMS makes up the online portion of their publication, and allows the students to add issues and essays to
      the site whenever they please.</p>
    <p>It's a very simple
      <code>CRUD</code> app, but it gets the job done.</p>
